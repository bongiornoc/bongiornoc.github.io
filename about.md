## About FiQuant

Established in 2007, the FiQuant team is dedicated to the empirical and theoretical study of financial markets, with a particular focus on market microstructure in order-driven markets. Our research spans three main directions:

- Empirical market microstructure
- Mathematical modeling in continuous time
- Numerical simulation of order books and trading strategies

Our work is supported by extensive databases, such as Thomson-Reuters TRTH, providing an invaluable environment for the development and validation of our models.
